# ChronoTune
This is the codebase for project ChronoTune, by DS Guitar Engineering.  This project is based on the Chronograph, but also includes circuitry for a chromatic tuner.  The tuner and clock will share a 4-character alphanumeric display.  The basic premise is that the pedal will normally operate as a Chronogrpah, but instant access to a tuner will be available at any time.  Another main goal is to allow user updateable drag-and-drop firmware via USB and a UF2 bootloader.
